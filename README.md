# Dragon-of-Kralstag-Public

Project Title: The Dragon of Kralstag

Project Description: This is a text-based adventure game which I created as a final project for a Java coding class in the spring of 2024. The aim of this project was to put my coding skills to this test to create a fun and engaging game. I hope you enjoy!

How to install and run the project: You will need an IDE with the Java JDK installed to run this game. You will need to download all the files in this repository to play the game. Once all necessary files have been downloaded, click the "run" button inside the file titled GameGUI.java to play the game. To play the game again, terminate the program and restart it.
